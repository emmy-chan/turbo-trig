# turbo-trig

this library is designed to be used with c++. simple to use, either use the glm version or standalone depending on your needs. it contains different approximation modes that you can switch between for speed using macros. this code can be easily ported to any language of choice. tests have been done on accuracy and some comments have been placed to showcase the maximum error but every function has it's own different precision. its best to leave the approximation on strong if you want to maintain accuracy. the quake square root has been included but is not reccomended, as it is just there to showcase a time where this sort of thing was ideal. for a faster alternative make sure to use the 'fast_sqrt' option. this library is mostly just for trigonometry but has functions for converting matrixes to a 3D vector / converting two 3D vector points into an angle. Which is why glm is used alongside it as these can be useful helper functions to have. Please feel free to include this in your project at no cost whatsoever :D Enjoy
